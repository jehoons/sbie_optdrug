### Table S1
Data is extracted from therapy data and mutation-copy number variation data

* (a) Data is extracted from mutation-copy number variation data, and cell line of data is large intestine and gene name of data is in network.

* (b) Data is extracted from therapy data, and cell line of data is large intestine and target of data is in network

* (c) Number of data in mutation-copy number variation data. By each cell line, large intestine, count the number of mutation ccle data and  cnv amplification ccle data and cnv deletion ccle data, and then count the number of data that has same gene name with network.

* (d) Number of data in therapy data. By each drug, count the number of total cell line data and the number of large intestine data. Then, find the target of each drug and compare the target with network.
